    <p>I taught my final course in fall 2019. You can view a <a href="">video of my last lecture,</a>which was not about computer science.</p>
<hr>
<p>Khan Academy now carries<a href="">algorithms tutorials</a>for which <a href="">Devin Balkcom</a> and i produced content</p>
<hr>
<p>Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in <i>introduction to algorithms</i></p>
<P>If you are, then see the <a href="">frequently asked questions and answer</a>below.</P>
<p>If you request solutions from me, i will not respond</p>
<hr> 
<p>From july 2004 through june 2008, i was the direct of the <a href="">Dartmouth institute for writing and Rhetoric.</a></p>
<P>I occasionally taught a graduate computer science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a<a href="">list of usage rules</a> that i require my students to observe</P>
<hr>
<p>In 2015 PRI'S"The world" ran a <a href="">story on mentoring women in computer science </a>in which a couple of my students and i were interviewed.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was interviewd for the <i>Command line Heroes podcast</i><a href="">"Learning the BASICs"</a> <br> You can also hear me spout off in <a href="">"philosophical Trials#7</a></p>
<p> I talked about writing <i>introduction to algorithms</i> in <a href="">an episode of "Frank Stajano Explains"</a><br> and an <a href="">"interview with aq brazilian vlogger.</a></p>

    <h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>
    <p>Yes i am a coauthor of <i>introduction of algorithms</i> along with <a href="">charles Leirson,Ron Rivest</a>and<a href="">Cliff Stein.</a>For MIT press's 50th anniversary,I wrote<br>a post on their blog about<a href="">the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.</a></p>
    <p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions abouth <i>introduction</i></p>
    <p><i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so when will it be available</i></p>
    
     <p><center>The fourth edition was released on 5th April 2022.The <a href="">MIT press site for the book</a>has link to sites that sell it</center></p> 
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">for the fourth editon, we maintain an, <a href="errata page ">errata page</a> that allows ypou to list errors by date, by page, pr by severity,</p>
    <p>how do i report errors</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">first, please vissit the <a href="errata page">errata page</a> to verify that errors has not been reported alreasy, Once you have determined that you have found an <br> unreported errpr, send email to <a href="clrs-bugs @mit,edu,">clrs-bugs</a> we will respond as quickly as possible often with in a day.</p>
    <h2>i will not respond to requests for the manual or for solutions.</h2>
    <p>How can i <i>typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode</i> in the book </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">i created three packages  for LateTeX2e the <i>clrscode3e</i> package givesyoun pseudocde in the style of the second edition <br> you can download the <i>clrscode</i> package <a href="here">here</a> and its documentation <a href="here">here</a> </p>
    <h2>Algorithms Unlockede</h2>
    <p><i>algorirthms unlocked</i> is a gentler, less technical, entr5y into algorithms than <i>than introduction to Algorithms </i> it contaimns some mathematics , but not nearly <br>   i maintain an <a href="errata page ">errata page </a> for <i>algorithms unblocked </i>if you find an error in te book and its not already in the <a href="errata page">errata page</a> send email to <a href="algorithms  unlocked@mit,edu">algorithms ulocked</a> <br>(the email address in the prefasce of the book in incorrect-the first known error in the book) </p>
